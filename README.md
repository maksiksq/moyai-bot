# 🗿🍷 Moyai bot
Speaks for itself.

Sends 🗿🍷 after every message. For ultimate drip. For an unmeasurable amount of class.

### ⚙️ options
- By default, the bot sends 🗿🍷 everywhere, to restrict that to a specific list of channels, use:
``/whitelist <channel>``<br>
- To remove a channel from the whitelist use: ``/unwhitelist <channel>``<br>
- To get the whitelist do: ``/list``<br>
- You can also disable the bot altogether with ``/onoff <On | Off>``
- You can make the bot send 🗿🍷 only with a rare (1/1000) chance if you enable raremode: ``/raremode <On | Off>``

### ☝ also
10% chance for it to secretly send a moyai with sunglasses. Yes the power of that is too much to handle on every send, too much drip. In raremode that's 1/10000 chance for every message.
